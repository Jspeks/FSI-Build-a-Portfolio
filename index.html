<!-- 1. Create a DIV element to contain the page content -->
<div>
  <!-- 2. Inside your DIV, create an H1 tag that contains your name as the text -->
    <h1>Jesse Specht</h1>

  <!-- 3. Below your H1 tag, create an H2 tag that contains the content text "Software Developer" -->
    <h2>Software Develpoer</h2>

  <!-- 4. Below your H2 tag, create an HR tag which will make a horizontal line -->
    <hr/>

  <!-- 5. Create a paragraph tag and put a sentence of your choice in it. (Suggestion: "My favorite thing about programming is _______") -->
  <!-- 6. Make the word "favorite" italicized -->
       <p>My <i>favorite</i> thing about programming is the freedom of creation that comes with it.</p>

  <!-- 7. Make an image tag with the src attribute linked to a picture of yourself or of a placeholder image. Make sure you make an alt attribute too! -->
     <img alt="Spartan Selfie Baby" src="./Portfolio-images/Spartan-Selfie.jpg" height="200" width="200">

  <!-- 8. Create an H3 tag that says "About Me" -->
    <h3>About Me</h3>

  <!-- 9. Create a paragraph tag that contains the "lorem ipsum" text. You will need to do a search for this text - it is long! -->
     <h1>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Unde sint nemo et esse modi saepe libero ea magni consectetur iusto? Nesciunt odio qui earum mollitia molestiae facere, itaque cum quidem.</h1>

<!-- 10. Create an H3 tag that says "My Projects" -->
     <h3>My Projects</h3>

<!-- 11. Create an unordered list with 3 list items that say "Project 1", "Project 2", and "Project 3" -->
  <ul>
    <li>Project 1</li>
    <li>Project 2</li>
    <li>Project 3</li>
  </ul>

<!-- 12. Add another H3 that contains "Contact Me" as text -->
      <h3>Contact Me</h3>

<!-- 13. Create a paragraph that contains a fake phone number, e.g., "Phone: (202) 555-1234" -->
    <p>1-800-555-5653</p>

<!-- 14. Create a link tag (<a>) with a direction to mail to a fake email address. This is done by making a regular link, but in the href attribute, put mailto:fake@email.com (this opens up your email program with the TO field already filled out-try it!) -->
     <a href="mailto:fake@email.com">Email Me</a>

</div>
    <!-- 
      Directions:

        BONUS: Try one of the following ideas if you finish early
          - Switch out your lorem ipsum for Hipster Ipsum (https://hipsum.co/)
          - In your contact me section, make the text "Phone:" and "Email:" bolded
     -->
